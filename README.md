# Simplex Planet Generator

A procedural planet generator using Three.js and simplex-noise. This project creates 3D planets with realistic terrain features using noise functions.

## Features

- Procedurally generated terrain using simplex noise
- Realistic color mapping based on elevation
- Interactive controls for rotation speed and noise scale
- Responsive design that adapts to window size

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

## Controls

- **Rotation Speed**: Adjusts how fast the planet rotates
- **Noise Scale**: Controls the level of detail in the terrain generation

## Future Enhancements

- Add temperature and moisture simulation for biome generation
- Implement erosion simulation
- Add atmosphere and cloud effects
- Enable planet customization and export
- Add day/night cycle simulation
